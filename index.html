							<h2>Hi, I'm Justin.</h2>
							<p>A proud graduate of Florida State University College of Motion Picture Arts, I have spent my career specializing in the creative and technical development of visual effects. My experience as both a visual effects artist and coordinator working in the fast-paced world of network television has provided me with the skills and tenacity necessary to adapt to a variety of projects and environments. I am currently working full time for Warner Bros Television in sunny Burbank, California on DC's Legends of Tomorrow season four.</p>

							<p>After convincing two young boys to help him break into the dirty trailer of a dangerous meth-cooking psychopath, a friendly yokel must decide whether stealing back his most prized rock and roll album from the crazed and enraged meth-head is more important than the lives of the two bewildered boys caught in the middle of his mess.

							<h2>PLANTADO (2015)</h2>
							<p>In 1962, Jose Pujals Mederos - a Cuban patriot and devoted family man - was sentenced to death by Fidel Castro's communist regime for his political opposition to the newly established totalitarian government. Fifty-three years later, Jose shares the incredibly powerful story of his horrible mistreatment and miraculous journey home with a group of young filmmakers, imparting upon them the lessons he learned as a Plantado - an uncompromising symbol of freedom and devotion.
